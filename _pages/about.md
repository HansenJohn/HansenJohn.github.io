我是东北大学信息学院[东北大学](https://www.neu.edu.cn/)24级的一名研究生。我的研究兴趣主要集中在计算机视觉领域，尤其对开放世界目标检测这一方向充满热情。我很幸运，目前跟随陈东岳教授在东北大学人工智能实验室进行研究。\

**I am a graduate student in the School of Information Science and Engineering at Northeastern University [NEU](https://www.neu.edu.cn/), class of 2024.** My research interests primarily lie in the field of computer vision, with a particular passion for open-world object detection. I am fortunate to be conducting research under the guidance of Professor Dongyue Chen at the Northeastern University Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
